Thesis
    - go threw each line 
    - have a flag for all increasing, all decreasing and 1 < abs(diff) < 3
    - flag when equal numbers are seen (could be done by 
      keeping track fo previous index)
    - running sum for unsafe or safe by looking at the flags 
      (a certain combo of flags is bad and another combo is good)
